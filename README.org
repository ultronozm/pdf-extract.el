#+title: pdf-extract.el: Extract page ranges from PDF files
#+author: Paul Nelson

* Overview

=pdf-extract= is an Emacs package that provides a simple interface for extracting page ranges from PDF files using the =qpdf= command-line tool.

* Installation

1. Install the =qpdf= command-line tool:
   - On macOS: =brew install qpdf=
   - On Linux: =apt-get install qpdf= or equivalent
   - On Windows: Download from https://qpdf.sourceforge.io/

2. Install the package via your preferred method, e.g.:
   - download =pdf-extract.el= and use =M-x package-install-file=, or
   - via =elpaca=:
     #+begin_src elisp
(use-package pdf-extract
  :ensure (:host github :repo "ultronozm/pdf-extract.el"))
     #+end_src

* Usage

The main entry point is the command =M-x pdf-extract-pages=. This will:
1. Prompt for a PDF file (you can use =M-n= to select the current buffer's file)
2. Prompt for a page range (e.g., "1-3" or "1,3-5")
3. Create the new PDF and open it

By default, extracted PDFs are stored in =~/pdf-extracts=. You can customize this with:
#+begin_src elisp
(setq pdf-extract-directory "~/your/preferred/location")  ; or
(setq pdf-extract-directory nil)  ; to store alongside source PDFs
#+end_src

The function can also be called programmatically:
#+begin_src elisp
(pdf-extract-pages "input.pdf" "1-3")
#+end_src
